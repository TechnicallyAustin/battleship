// Gameboard is defined as a function
    // calls ship factory function to place ships
    // places the ships via coordinates as arguments
    
    // recieve attack function
        // takes a pair of coordinates
        // determines if the attack hits or misses
        // sends hit() to the correct ship || // records a missed shot

    // gameboard can keep track of missed attacks and display them
    // gameboard can report if all ships have been sunk or not.
